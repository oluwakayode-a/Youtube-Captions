below<br>the united states military the largest<br>most powerful<br>most dangerous fighting force on the<br>planet a military that hasn't been<br>involved in a defensive war since the<br>1940s<br>yet whose budget continues to balloon<br>every year<br>u.s military spending currently exceeds<br>that of the next 10 nations combined<br>we have over 600 military bases outside<br>our borders<br>occupying over 80 countries around the<br>world the united states<br>military while it tries to sell itself<br>as a force for freedom and democracy<br>is not a welcome sight in much of the<br>world our aggressive posturing bullying<br>and occupation has turned world opinion<br>against the us armed forces over the<br>past few decades<br>and it's not hard to see why when you<br>think of a modern fighting force<br>you typically think of tanks fighter<br>jets humvees drones and aircraft<br>carriers<br>but these giant death machines don't<br>operate on their own<br>the us military like any other relies on<br>recruits<br>americans willing to pick up arms and<br>kill for their country<br>in this episode we're going to take a<br>look at the state of u.s military<br>recruiting<br>and the shady tactics used by the armed<br>forces to rope in new soldiers<br>before we begin let's take a second to<br>discuss why the u.s feels like it needs<br>such a massive military<br>since the end of world war ii and<br>certainly since the end of the cold war<br>the united states has been the sole<br>world superpower this has given the<br>country the luxury of using that power<br>to clamp down on the world's economy<br>with an iron grip<br>the u.s relies on other countries<br>relying on it<br>if another country doesn't feel the need<br>to grovel for u.s assistance and trade<br>deals<br>the u.s military will often be called in<br>to create an environment<br>that forces that country to re-evaluate<br>if crippling sanctions aren't enough<br>boots on the ground certainly will be<br>but if the united states already has<br>such a stranglehold on the rest of the<br>world<br>why does the military budget keep<br>increasing a large part of it is to feed<br>the ravenous military-industrial complex<br>and deliver lucrative contracts to<br>companies like boeing<br>lockheed and raytheon but more recently<br>u.s officials have cited the possibility<br>of a great power conflict with china<br>that kind of talk should alarm us the<br>last great power conflict<br>though it never devolved into outright<br>war was the cold war with the soviet<br>union<br>during which time we almost caused<br>nuclear annihilation on multiple<br>occasions<br>before that it was world war ii if u.s<br>officials are gearing up to start<br>another war of this magnitude<br>the world is in for a very bad time with<br>this aggressive rhetoric becoming more<br>common<br>the u.s military has been adamant about<br>maintaining a fighting force of 500 000<br>soldiers<br>and this requires an intense recruiting<br>program<br>so how does the world's largest military<br>entice the next generation of soldiers<br>well these days it seems to be with<br>cartoons that appropriate inclusive<br>language<br>video games and taking advantage of<br>those in poverty<br>let's start with the video games i'm<br>sure you're all familiar with twitch<br>if somehow you're not twitch is the<br>largest live streaming platform in<br>operation right now<br>they bring in insane numbers of both<br>streamers and viewers averaging roughly<br>3 million concurrent viewers at any<br>given time<br>who watch a total of around half a<br>billion hours of content per week<br>that's a huge audience and a lot of time<br>spent on individual streams<br>which can run for hours as far as<br>demographics go<br>the audience skews young and male with<br>about 65 percent of viewers being male<br>41 between the ages of 16 and 24 and 73<br>between the ages of 16 and 34. to<br>military recruiters twitch is a dream<br>come true<br>you have a captive audience of young<br>impressionable viewers who tend to<br>develop parasocial relationships with<br>the streamers they watch<br>it's the perfect medium for young<br>charismatic recruiters to pitch the<br>military to the next generation<br>and they know this in 2018 the us army<br>launched its own twitch channel as part<br>of its new more modern approach to<br>recruitment<br>the navy followed suit shortly after in<br>the first six months of 2020<br>the military had bagged 13 000 new<br>recruiting<br>leads from twitch alone keep in mind<br>that many twitch users are underage<br>as you only have to be 13 years old to<br>make an account<br>so you have young incredibly malleable<br>children watching trained army and navy<br>recruiters play games like cod and<br>fortnite for hours on end<br>while they surreptitiously try to<br>convince their viewers to join the<br>military<br>if this sounds incredibly shady and<br>predatory that's because it is<br>and it gets worse early in their<br>streaming endeavors<br>the army esports mods would ban users<br>for asking about u.s war crimes<br>until they were eventually forced to<br>unblock those people after accusations<br>of first amendment violations<br>then there's the navy claiming that<br>their streamers aren't recruiters<br>despite the fact that they're required<br>to take the same training courses as<br>navy recruiters before they're<br>considered for the role<br>the army even went so far as to just<br>straight up lie and put up a link to a<br>fraudulent xbox giveaway<br>which when clicked instead took you to<br>an army recruitment information form<br>this was later taken down by twitch<br>hassan [ __ ]<br>one of the most popular leftist<br>streamers rightly accused these<br>recruitment practices as being predatory<br>shout out to hassan by the way thanks<br>for boosting my videos you should all go<br>watch him if you don't already<br>now twitch is just one cog in the modern<br>military recruitment machine<br>another shameful practice is<br>specifically targeting poor students who<br>have few opportunities<br>back in the 70s the new york times ran a<br>story about how<br>sergeant hard times is the best<br>recruiter in the world<br>rightly pointing out the fact that in<br>times of economic precarity<br>people are driven to latch on to<br>whatever opportunities they can find<br>this is still very much the case today<br>when job or life prospects are lacking<br>recruiters can weaponize that fear and<br>uncertainty to press young people into<br>service<br>one recent program offers the perfect<br>example of how the military targets<br>those in precarious conditions<br>in what's been dubbed focus 22 the<br>pentagon has selected 22 cities which<br>have large black and latino populations<br>recruiters descend on these cities like<br>buzzards stationing themselves in<br>schools and public places to try to<br>ensnare as many young people as possible<br>some cities like baltimore have allowed<br>the military to install their<br>march to success software on all the<br>city's public computers<br>this software is meant to look like a<br>study aid but it also collects user data<br>so that recruiters can track down<br>anyone who uses it if keeping a database<br>of a city's young people sounds bad<br>just wait till you hear about the<br>jammers database jammers<br>or the joint advertising market research<br>study is a billion dollar database that<br>catalogs the data of over 30 million<br>americans between the ages of 16 and 25.<br>this database was classified as top<br>secret until 2005.<br>preying on the poor isn't new militaries<br>throughout history have used their poor<br>as cannon fodder while the rich<br>those benefiting from the wars never<br>have to send their children to die<br>it's a hideous practice and it reflects<br>very poorly on this nation that so many<br>people feel like they have no<br>alternative<br>so we've seen soldiers trying to ensnare<br>underage gamers to become pawns in their<br>death machine<br>and government programs to collect the<br>peasants and ship them off to blow up<br>their fellow human beings on the other<br>side of the world<br>but there's one more aspect of the<br>military's recruitment initiative that<br>we should discuss<br>and in a surprising twist it's probably<br>the one that's gotten the most bad press<br>for as long as we've had a military<br>there have been propaganda campaigns to<br>try to convince citizens to enlist<br>for the last couple decades recruitment<br>ads have generally looked like something<br>out of blackhawk down or call of duty<br>big scary guys driving amphibious<br>vehicles rappelling out of helicopters<br>and running around shooting at bad guys<br>we never see<br>but in this most recent attempt at<br>winning over gen z<br>the army has taken a page out of the<br>cia's book and appropriated diverse<br>inclusive language as a way to say<br>hey we're modern and cool we're not just<br>a bunch of trigger-happy barbarians<br>we're just like you in a five-part ad<br>series titled the calling<br>the army shares what are supposedly<br>genuine stories from enlisted soldiers<br>but because the military knows that all<br>them young people care about is cartoons<br>they also animated the ads in a few<br>different styles<br>let's take a look at a few highlights<br>from the series<br>one time i snuck out and stayed three<br>days at a friend's place<br>when i came home mom wanted to teach me<br>to appreciate the life i had by sending<br>me to the dominican republic to stay<br>with relatives for a year<br>[Applause]<br>one day at school i came upon an army<br>recruiter<br>and told him about my goals he took me<br>through all their different careers<br>and that's when it hit me the army is an<br>army of good people<br>pay close attention to how seemingly<br>innocuous statements are phrased<br>i was bad so my mom sent me to another<br>country to see how bad it is compared to<br>the united states<br>when i came back i realized that the us<br>is the best country on earth and the<br>army is good because america is good<br>so as soon as i turned 17 i asked for my<br>dad's blessing to enlist<br>but having served in the army during the<br>vietnam era<br>responding to civil unrest he said no<br>he had his reasons i hope his reasons<br>were recognition of the fact that the<br>vietnam war was<br>just one long string of u.s war crimes<br>during which period we massacred<br>innocent people<br>dropped more bombs than during the<br>entire second world war<br>riddled the land with millions of mines<br>rained fire down on civilian populations<br>and used chemical weapons which are<br>still causing cancer and birth defects<br>to this day<br>all for a conflict we never should have<br>initiated in the first place<br>of course by the end of the ad dad is<br>proud of his little girl for joining<br>anyway<br>but it was one day during a 9 11<br>ceremony<br>i started seeing the army in a new light<br>over 3 000 students lined the walls and<br>the balconies of my school<br>my whole community was there including<br>firefighters and service members<br>from every military branch the silent<br>show of respect for this country<br>was stephanie i was now determined to<br>defend<br>this nation that i called home to not<br>only be a citizen<br>but a soldier as well this is another<br>common tactic<br>hey remember that bad thing that<br>happened look how strong it made us<br>look how respectful everyone is of the<br>flag and our country i'm gonna join the<br>army<br>of course there's no mention of the fact<br>that 911 was used as justification to<br>start an unjustifiable war<br>which claimed over a million lives<br>destabilized an entire region for<br>decades<br>and dragged on for so long that<br>americans who enlisted back then<br>have now been able to watch their<br>children go off to murder the children<br>of the people they didn't manage to kill<br>the us military-industrial complex is<br>very skilled at using the symbology of<br>the flag as a way to deflect blame<br>promote a victim complex and play up the<br>american exceptionalism myth all at the<br>same time<br>for many people this kind of ad can be<br>quite effective<br>but the one that got the most attention<br>and we'll explore why afterwards<br>is this one this is the story of a<br>soldier who operates your nation's<br>patriot missile defense<br>systems<br>it begins in california with a little<br>girl<br>raised by two moms<br>i like to think i've been defending<br>freedom from an early age<br>i needed my own adventures my own<br>challenge<br>and after meeting with an army recruiter<br>i found it<br>a way to prove my inner strength and<br>maybe shatter some stereotypes<br>along the way if you take a look at this<br>ad on youtube<br>or any of them really you'll see that<br>they got absolutely eviscerated by the<br>viewers<br>the like to dislike ratio is among the<br>worst i've ever seen<br>and of course the comments are turned<br>off because there likely wouldn't be a<br>single positive one<br>why did these ads flop so hard the army<br>managed to outsmart itself and alienate<br>all of their potential recruits those on<br>the political right are all up in arms<br>over the woke language<br>and outraged at the idea that the army<br>is trying to appeal to people who<br>clearly don't belong in the military<br>though it is funny to watch these<br>reactionary losers have their little<br>meltdown<br>what's more important is why the ads<br>fell flat for their target audience<br>younger more progressive members of gen<br>z trying to be more inclusive is good<br>acknowledging the validity of all sorts<br>of quote non-traditional backgrounds<br>is important but it shouldn't be<br>surprising that gen z<br>the most anti-war anti-capitalist<br>generation in decades<br>sees right through the propaganda i like<br>to think i've been defending freedom<br>from a young age<br>come on young people know what the us<br>military gets up to<br>they live on the internet they can find<br>plenty of evidence of the mountains of<br>war crimes the u.s commits<br>they're aware of past military policies<br>against gay and trans service members<br>but more than that they're aware that<br>being allowed to serve in the military<br>isn't some great victory for the lgbt<br>community<br>because no one should want to invade<br>other countries and oppress their fellow<br>human beings<br>no matter how hard the military tries to<br>rebrand itself as a woke force for good<br>freedom and democracy<br>no matter how cute they try to make<br>missile launchers most young people<br>won't fall for it<br>they know they're being targeted with<br>short eye-catching animated propaganda<br>of course these ads will appeal to some<br>young people<br>and they'll soon find themselves in a<br>situation that is nothing like what's<br>been presented to them<br>and that's a shame it's despicable that<br>the military has to steal data corrupt<br>underage stream viewers<br>target the poor and desperate and try to<br>sell a lie to meet their quota of cannon<br>fodder for a great power conflict the<br>united states so clearly wants<br>the military always has and always will<br>use shady<br>predatory tactics to fill their ranks<br>the best we can do is be aware of it<br>provide truthful information about what<br>joining the military really means<br>and work towards building a society that<br>doesn't funnel the poor<br>and the impressionable young into the<br>imperialist war machine<br>without soldiers to fly their drones<br>fire their rockets and drop their bombs<br>the military can't function it can't<br>bully the rest of the world<br>and that sounds pretty good<br>[Music]<br>if you'd like to see what great power<br>conflict looks like to truly understand<br>the horror<br>of world war i highly recommend you<br>check out apocalypse world war<br>ii on
